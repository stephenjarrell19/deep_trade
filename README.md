# Deep Trade

A home for all trading analytics, POC agents, indicator generators, supervised modeling, and reinforcement learning / policy learning.


##  Motivation

Develop a bot that can identify support and resistance levels and optimize for R-values. The goal is not to develop a model that trades for breakouts, but instead a model that trades to minimize risk and maximize R.

## Proofs of Concept (POCs)

Some indicators:
- Bollinger Bands
- 9 EMA and 20 EMA divergence
- Scalping
- Support and Resistance

Create a very accurate neural network for identifying ONLY support and resistance levels. If you can draw a border that can identify the box of support and resistance on any given stock (based on its historical data) consistently, then match that across different time frames, with a high degree of accuracy, then optimize for R values.

Trying to create a NN that can look at a chart over multiple time frames, and it needs to be able to: 
  1. Draw support and resistance areas
  2. Interpolate over time (matching or correlating support levels to make support patterns more salient)
 
 If 1 and 5 min support lines correlate, then its more salient.
 
 The strategy is human-based. "When x happens, you can buy and sell at y."

**Use R-values as optimization metrics.**
