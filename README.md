# Deep Trade

A home for all trading analytics, POC agents, indicator generators, supervised modeling, and reinforcement learning / policy learning.

##  Motivation

Develop a bot that can identify support and resistance levels and optimize for R-values. The goal is not to develop a model that trades for breakouts, but instead a model that trades to minimize risk and maximize R.

## Proof of Concept 

Create a very accurate neural network for identifying ONLY support and resistance levels. If you can draw a border that can identify the box of support and resistance on any given stock (based on its historical data) consistently, then match that across different time frames, with a high degree of accuracy, then optimize for Risk to Reward values (R).
## Implementation ideas
### SnR Charter
Trying to create a NN that can look at a chart over multiple time frames, and it needs to be able to: 
  1. Draw support and resistance areas
  2. Interpolate over time (matching or correlating support levels to make support patterns more salient)
 
 If 1 and 5 min support lines correlate, then its more salient.
 ### Broker
 
Trained on Human_trader strategy, using "When x happens, you can buy and sell at y."
 interfaces with SnR charter and _____(other input streams) to decide to take setup or not.

**Use R-values as optimization metrics.**
